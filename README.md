The Rock-Paper-Scissors game is a classic hand game played between two individuals. In this game, players compete against the computer, which randomly selects one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors. The rules are simple:

1.Rock crushes scissors.
2.Scissors cuts paper.
3.Paper covers rock.

One feature I add in this common game is Sound Effect.This will make game intresting and enjoyable.

How to play?
Follow the on-screen instructions to select your choice (rock, paper, or scissors).
The computer will randomly select its choice.
The game will determine the winner based on the rules of Rock-Paper-Scissors.
Continue playing until you decide to quit or reach the end of the game.
